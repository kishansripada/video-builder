    "prompt": "What's the most fucked up thing you discovered about your 'perfect' family member?",
    "body": "My uncle Tom was the golden child of our family. Successful lawyer, beautiful wife, two kids, volunteer firefighter. But I always got weird vibes from him.\n\nLast Thanksgiving, I got hammered and decided to snoop in his study. In the back of a drawer, I found a burner phone. Curiosity piqued, I cracked it open.\n\nHoly shit. It was full of texts arranging meetups with prostitutes. But not just any prostitutes - very young-looking ones. My stomach turned as I scrolled through graphic photos and messages.\n\nThen I saw it. A video. Tom was there, with a girl who couldn't have been more than 15. I won't describe what happened, but I threw up right there on his fancy Persian rug.\n\nI anonymously sent everything to the cops. A week later, Tom was arrested. Turns out he was part of a huge trafficking ring. The fallout destroyed our family.\n\nNow I can't look at family photos without seeing his smarmy fucking face, knowing what he did. Sometimes I wish I'd never looked in that drawer."
